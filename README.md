A simple script made for the 1999 game Re-Volt enabling count of custom points for race position, defined in a dict, via parsing a .csv log file created automatically by the game run with "-sessionlog" argument.

Designed for a team classification over a run of consecutive races stored in the log file. If the desired classification would originate from multiple files - paste the relevant part of the code and plug in the log path as many times as needed.

The script adds up driver standings based on a specific tag which can be customized, the default being 'BLU' and 'GRN' for two separate teams.
